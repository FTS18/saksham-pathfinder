##  Mobile App: Paused Indefinitely

**Decision:** Mobile app development PAUSED

**Reason:** 
- Web app requires 100% optimization first
- NativeWind integration complex
- Metro bundler setup issues
- Better to perfect web, then mobile

**Location:** `C:\Web\saksham-mobile`

**To Resume in Future:**
1. Fix NativeWind className issues
2. Configure Metro bundler properly
3. Set up iOS/Android SDKs
4. Test on physical devices
5. Release to app stores

**Current Status:**
- 6 screens fully implemented
- Firebase configured
- Dependencies installed (1,763 packages)
- 100+ TypeScript errors (not prioritized)
