## 🚀 START HERE - One Command

```bash
npm run test:firestore:rules
```

This command:
- ✅ Works **anywhere** (no ports needed)
- ✅ Takes **~1 second**
- ✅ Tests **28 collections**
- ✅ Validates **permissions & security**
- ✅ **Zero dependencies** (pure Node.js)
- ✅ **Port-independent** (works if dev server is on 3000, 3001, or offline)

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ All 28 collections have rules
✅ Default deny rule configured
✅ Auth functions defined
✅ Ready for deployment
```

---

## 📊 What's Tested

### Collections (28 Total)
All your data collections have security rules:
- `profiles`, `users`, `usernames` 
- `applications`, `notifications`, `internships`
- `gamification`, `recruiters`, `feedback`
- `userPreferences`, `chats`, `jobs`
- ... and 16 more

### Permissions Validated
- ✅ Owner-only access
- ✅ Public data access (with `isPublic` flag)
- ✅ Admin overrides
- ✅ Default deny on unknown collections
- ✅ Subcollection permissions
- ✅ Multi-party access (e.g., recruiter + applicant)

### Security Best Practices Checked
- ✅ Default deny rule exists
- ✅ Auth functions defined (`isAuthenticated`, `isOwner`, `isAdmin`)
- ✅ No overly permissive rules
- ✅ Resource conditions properly set
- ⚠️ Warns about hardcoded admin emails

## 🧪 Three Ways to Test

### Method 1: Quick CLI (Fastest - Use Daily)
```bash
npm run test:firestore:rules
```
- Time: ~1 second
- Best for: Development workflow
- Works: Offline, no servers needed
- Output: Validation report

### Method 2: Full Integration (Before Production)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start emulator
npm run test:firestore:emulator

# Terminal 2: Run tests
jest scripts/firestore-rules.test.ts --runInBand
```
- Time: ~10 seconds
- Best for: Major deployments
- Tests: 40+ actual Firestore scenarios
- Output: Detailed test results

### Method 3: Manual Console (Visual Verification)
1. Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules > Simulate
2. Enter test parameters
3. Click "Run"
- Time: ~2 minutes
- Best for: Final verification
- Scope: Test individual scenarios

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### CLI Validator (`scripts/test-firestore-rules.mjs`)

**What it does:**
- Reads `firestore.rules` file
- Parses all collection rules
- Validates permissions exist
- Checks security practices
- Tests access scenarios

**Features:**
- Zero dependencies (pure Node.js)
- Color-coded output
- Detailed reporting
- ~1 second execution

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/test-firestore-rules.mjs
npm run test:firestore:rules
```

### Jest Test Suite (`scripts/firestore-rules.test.ts`)

**What it does:**
- Uses `firebase-rules-unit-testing`
- Creates test environments
- Simulates user contexts
- Tests 40+ scenarios
- Full Firebase integration

**Coverage:**
- Authentication tests (logged in vs anonymous)
- Permission tests (owner, other, admin)
- Data access scenarios
- Subcollection permissions
- Default deny behavior

**Usage:**
```bash
# Requires Firebase emulator running first
jest scripts/firestore-rules.test.ts --runInBand
```

---

## ✅ Fixes Made to Rules

1. **Public Profiles** - Added `|| resource.data.isPublic == true`
   - Allows public profile viewing
   - Fixes PublicProfile.tsx access

2. **Username Registry** - Added `/usernames/{username}` collection
   - Public read for availability lookup
   - Owner-only write/delete
   - Needed by userService.ts

3. **Improved Permission Model** - Consolidated redundant rules
   - Cleaner, more maintainable
   - Same functionality, better structure

4. **Subcollection Support** - Added wildcard matches
   - ProfilePhotos nested docs now covered
   - Better permission inheritance

5. **Default Deny Rule** - Added catch-all deny
   - Any collection not explicitly allowed is denied
   - Security best practice

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run quick test: `npm run test:firestore:rules`
- [ ] Review changes: `git diff firestore.rules`
- [ ] Dry-run deployment: `firebase deploy --dry-run`
- [ ] Verify no errors in output
- [ ] Deploy: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- [ ] Confirm in Firebase Console (Rules tab)
- [ ] Test key scenarios in live app
- [ ] Monitor for permission errors

---

## 🎯 Typical Development Workflow

```
1. Edit rules in firestore.rules

2. Quick validation (1 sec)
   $ npm run test:firestore:rules
   
   If fails → Fix rules → Go to step 2
   If passes → Continue

3. Git commit with rules changes

4. When ready to deploy:
   $ firebase deploy --dry-run
   $ firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

5. Verify in production:
   - Test in live app
   - Check console for errors
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Permission denied" after deployment
**Check:**
1. Does document exist in Firestore?
2. Does document have required fields?
3. Is user properly authenticated?

### ⚠️ Hardcoded admin email warning
**Why:** Currently uses `admin@gmail.com` check  
**Solution:** Migrate to role-based approach in `/admins/{userId}`  
**Status:** Already supported, just add user to admins collection

### ❌ Validation fails
**Check:**
1. `firestore.rules` file syntax
2. Matching `{` and `}`
3. Semicolons at end of rules

**Fix:**
```bash
npm run test:firestore:rules
# Read error message
# Fix the syntax
# Run again
```
