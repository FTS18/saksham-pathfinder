# Recent Issues & Fixes Summary

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Firestore Index Required for Recruiter Query
**Problem**: ManageInternships was throwing error:
```
The query requires an index. You can create it here: https://console.firebase.google.com/...
```

**Root Cause**: Query with `where('recruiterId', '==', uid)` + `orderBy('createdAt')` needs a composite index

**Fix Applied**:
- Added composite index to `firestore.indexes.json`
- Fields: `recruiterId` (ASC) + `createdAt` (DESC)
- Query execution now fixed

**Status**: ✅ Fixed in code

### 2. ⚠️ Dashboard & Candidates Pages Still Using Dummy Data
**Problem**: 
- RecruiterDashboard shows hardcoded stats (12 jobs, 284 applications, etc.)
- Candidates page shows 6 mock candidates (Arjun Sharma, Priya Patel, etc.)
- Real data exists in Firebase but pages ignore it

**Current Status**: ⏳ Needs Implementation

**What's Needed**:
1. **RecruiterDashboard.tsx** - Replace hardcoded data with:
   - Actual job count from internships collection
   - Real application count from applications collection
   - Real candidate stats from profiles collection

2. **Candidates.tsx** - Replace mock candidates with:
   - Real candidates from applications (who applied to recruiter's jobs)
   - Real profile data from profiles collection
   - Real application status from applications collection

**How to Fix**:
```tsx
// Example: Load real stats
const loadDashboardStats = async () => {
  // Query internships collection where createdBy/recruiterId == currentUser.uid
  // Query applications collection for those jobs
  // Query profiles for candidate info
}
```

### 3. ⚠️ Profile Document Not Existing Error
**Problem**: Console errors when logging in as new user:
```
Error updating language: FirebaseError: No document to update: 
projects/saksham-ai-81c3a/databases/(default)/documents/profiles/{uid}
```

**Root Cause**: 
- New user tries to update profile preferences before profile document is created
- ThemeContext, LanguageContext trying to update non-existent document

**Current Status**: ⏳ Needs Investigation

**Likely Cause**:
- User registration doesn't create profile document properly
- Or profile document creation has permission issues

**How to Debug**:
1. Check user registration flow in `AuthContext.tsx`
2. Verify profile document is created during signup
3. Check Firestore rules for `/profiles/{userId}` - make sure `create` permission works
