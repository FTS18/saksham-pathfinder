## 🔧 Technical Details

### Root Cause Identified ✅
Theme changes happened before user loaded from Firebase Auth, causing Firestore saves to be skipped.

### Solution Implemented ✅
Added pending save tracking with automatic retry logic when user becomes available.

### Key Components
```
1. Pending State Tracking
   - pendingSaveTheme: Tracks theme changes that couldn't be saved
   - pendingSaveColor: Tracks color changes that couldn't be saved

2. Smart Save Logic
   - Try immediate save if user available
   - Queue for retry if user not ready
   - Clear flags on successful save

3. Retry Mechanism
   - useEffect watches for user loading
   - Detects pending saves
   - Retries all pending changes in single Firestore call
   - Clears flags after success

4. Transparent Logging
   - Info: What happened (emojis for quick scanning)
   - Warning: What might happen (pending saves)
   - Error: What went wrong (detailed messages)
```
